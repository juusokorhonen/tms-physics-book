# Electromagnetism

Everything starts with the four Maxwell's equations:

$$
\bf{\nabla}\times\bf{B} = \frac{ \partial \bf{E}}{\partial t} \qquad \text{(Faraday's Law)}
$$

$$
\bf{\nabla}\times\bf{E} = - \frac{\partial \bf{B}}{\partial t} \qquad \text{(Amp√®re's Law)}
$$

$$
\bf{\nabla}\cdot\bf{B} = 0 \qquad \text{(Gauss's Law)}
$$

$$
\bf{\nabla}\cdot\bf{E} = \frac{\rho}{{\varepsilon}_0} \qquad \text{(Colomb's Law)}
$$

To know the effects of TMS we have to compute the induced electric field in the brain tissue. Consider an electric current  I=2 changing over time.
